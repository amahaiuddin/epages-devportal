Cypress is a tool for developers or QA engineers to write all types of tests:

- End-to-end tests
- Integration tests
- Unit tests

Cypress can be used to test anything that runs on browser.
Test automation script can be written easily in JavaScript which makes the tool developer-friendly.
It makes testing easier because one does not need to install multiple tools to run end-to-end tests.
All the needed tools are packed in one tool.

## Some of the features of Cypress:

- Time travel: Screenshots of every command is available on the test runner, it’s easy to see how the commands get executed.

- Automatic waiting: Cypress waits for assertions and commands to be finished before moving on. A developer does not need to add waiting time for completion of a query.

- Real time reloads: When changes are made on code and saved, Cypress reloads automatically and starts running tests.

- Auto scroll: The automatic scrolling operation ensures that an element is in view before performing any action (for example Clicking on a button).

- Debuggability:  All the errors and stack trace can be read from browser developer tool and that helps to find out why tests are failing. The debugging is fast and easy.

- Videos: Videos of whole test suite is can be viewed when run from CLI.

- Cross browser Testing: Web application can be tested on different browsers to test browser dependability issues.

- Test runs faster: Cypress runs test as fast as the browser render the content.

## Installing the Cypress

[Installation](https://docs.cypress.io/img/snippets/installing-cli.b927778a.mp4){:target="_blank"} of Cypress is easy and fast.
You only need few commands for the installation:

{
    $ cd /your/project/path
    $ npm init
    $ npm install Cypress --save-dev
}

Cypress can be opened from the project root by the command:

{
    $ ./node_modules/.bin/Cypress open
}


## The Test Runner

Cypress test runner will open after running the above command.

Test suits are the files that end with .spec.js extension.
The drop on the top-right corner shows available browser on one’s computer.
Any browser can be selected to carry out cross-browser tests.

## Retry-ability

One of the core features of Cypress is that failed test can be retried multiple times.
By default, test does not retry on fail but it can be enabled in configuration to retry test when failed.
If a test passes, Cypress will move forward to carry out remaining tests.
But if the test fails, Cypress will retry the test for another time until it reaches the set limit of retries.

Retry-ability can reduce flaky tests failing entire test runs and thus help us to get reliable and consistent result.

## TypeScript integration

Developers who like to use [TypeScript](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/tooling/typescript-support.html#Install-TypeScript){:target="_blank"} for writing Cypress test, it’s possible.
That’s amazing! There is a requirement to have TypeScript 3.4+ installed in the project to have Typescript support within Cypress.

## Plugins

Use of [plugins](https://docs.cypress.io/plugins/index.html){:target="_blank"} in cypress provides additional benefit to QA engineers.
This can be used to change resolved configuration programmatically, expand functionality, add new features and commands.
Cypress has nice [documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/writing-a-plugin.html#Plugins-API){:target="_blank"} on how to write a plugin.

## Summary

Cypress is a great choice for testers to carry out front-end testing because it is fast, reliable and full of advantageous features.
