In 2018 we published our blog post [Let's talk about numbers](/blog/on-the-job/lets-talk-about-numbers/){:target="_blank"}, where we talked to our Software Developers, Designers, UX experts, Technical writers, and Scrum Masters about stuff we do and like here at ePages. 

Some time has passed since this blog post. So, I was wondeingering what has changed since then: How many #womenintech are we now? What are the top 3 programming languages our developers are using? And many more new questions. 
This time, I talked to our Backend teams, Frontend teams, TechComm team, Scrum Masters, Application Management, and Product Management. This infographic an updated version of who we are and what we stand for:

Note: For some questions several answers were given - resulting in some answers being over 100%.
