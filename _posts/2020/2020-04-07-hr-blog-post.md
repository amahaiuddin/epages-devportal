Throughout the year ePages is not only joining various events such as conferences and meetups, but also some job fairs for interested developers which are organized by German universities. You might already have checked out upcoming events. 
At ePages our HR team is taking care of the job fairs and organizing them. 
Why it is important to visit job fairs and what our HR team has experienced so far, they will tell us in the following interview. 


## Which kinds of job fairs do you visit? And how do you decide which job fairs you visit?

In the first place, we are visting job fairs which are organized by German universities.
We want to attract young talents and therefore we choose job fairs near our office locations Hamburg and Jena such as the Stellenwerk Job Fair at the Campus University in Hamburg or the Firmenkontaktbörse at the University Jena in Jena. 
Thereby, our main focus is primarly on students and young professionals. 
But we also visit job fairs for a wider audience like the Jobwalk Jena which is an open air job fair in Jena, the Data Science Day in Jena which is a series of lectures with additional jobfair in the break hall. In Hamburg we are visiting for example the Hacker X which is a special invite-only event to meet talented developers in a rapid-interview format, to ensure everyone has a chance to tell us their story and background. 


## Why are job fairs important for you as HR? 

Basically, it is not only important for us, but also for ePages as a company, to represent ePages and our great company culture. 
For us as HR we want to connect with people directly, find young potentials especially for internships or working student positions. 
It is important for us to get in contact with young devs again and again and to give young potentials as many skills as possible on their way as internships, working students or in the supervision of final papers.
Furthermore, we want to learn more about the needs of the new candidantes but also of course to find new colleagues in general.


## How do you prepare for such job fairs?

First of all we are looking which job fairs we would like to visit around Hamburg and Jena.
After we decided which job fairs we would like to visit, we start with planning different dates over the year. 
Then we plan who is participating which job fair. 
Of course whos participating from the HR team but also from the developers to answer technical questions from visitors. 
Later on, we prepare our material which we need for the job fairs such as give-aways, sweets or job descriptions. 


## Which employees visit the job fairs? Is it always only HR?

Sometimes we are only represented by our HR team. 
But usally, it's not only the HR team who is visiting the job fairs. 
Normally, we are mixed team with 2-3 employees which also include Developers, Project Managers, and Scrum Masters too. 
We are really happy that they are supporting us. 
Their support makes it easier for us to answer divers questions especially with technical background from the visitors. 
Furthermore, they can give a deeper insight into their job and explain them certain workflows. 


## What kind of questions do you get asked (typically)? Which questions do you want to be asked? 

We get a lot questions about 
Students are often interested in possibilities like internship, bachelor/masters thesis or working student positions. 
Besides that, they often ask  about application procedures. 
Lots of them are also interested in our tech stack and how international we are as a company. 
We are really looking forward to having a great conversation with the visitors, questions are always good but there is no right or wrong. 


## What has been the craziest or most curious question a visitor asked you? 

…muss ich nochmal überlegen (viele Leute wundern sich über unseren “Join the force”-Stand^^)
”I don’t need a job, but can I take one of your lovely “Lieblingskollege”-cards to give it as present to my colleagues?” 
(Last time at the INOVA Ilmenau one of the security guards asked this question) 
Some people just want to grab our goodies, that’s nice but we also want them to be interested in our company. 


## What happens if a visitor is really interested in a job at ePages? How does the further process looks like on/after such a job fair? 

If the conversation turns out positive, we often share contact data with each other and contact the interested person in the next coming days and then start the application process. 
If the conversation turns out positive, we often share contact data with each other and contact the interested person in the next coming days to receive their CV and references and ideally organise an interview. 


## Are all job fairs the same? Which highlights have you experienced so far? Which one do you like most? 

One of the highlights is the jobwalk in Jena as it is an open air job fair at the market place. 
There are so many visitors and it is really crowded what is perfect for many great meets. 
But all job fairs are a highlight for us, because they give us the opportunitiy to get to know new potential colleagues. 

## Do/ Did we have an ePagee that you first met on a job fair?
Our working students in Jena, Gregor and Konstantin   

## Any last advice for visitors of job fairs? (Should they bring their CV, wear a suit, or just be friendly and open-minded?)

(Just come as you are and be interested and open for a good conversation.) 
The visitors should be able to give us a brief summary of their experiences and projects at uni, even more helpful if they bring their CV with them. 
That’s the easiest way to find out if there is a match. 


It is important to us to get in contact with young devs again and again and to give young potentials as many skills as possible on their way as internships, working students or in the supervision of final papers.
